# gesture-vocalizer-system
Simple Engineering Project for electronics students done using the At-Tiny 85 microcontroller and the android application. Android app play commands with reference to hand gestures.
## Steps to be followed
	1. Change Values of RX, TX, flex1, flex2 according to circuite.
	2. Make sure flex1 & flex2 is on Analog pins.
	3. Change Threshold according to requirements.
	4. How to upload code in Attiny 85 using arduino check the Video on youtube.
	5. Make sure software Serial Libery is installed in Arduino IDE
	5. After flashing the code in Attiny85 put it in circuite.
	6. Pair smartphone with bluetooth module.
	7. Install the Myproject.apk Application in smartphone.
	8. Select Paired Bluetooth module in application.
	9. Bend the flex sensors and check working, If not try to change Threshold value.
	10. Check the command is playing through Application.


## Requriments :
	Arduino IDE
	At-Tiny 85 & Arduino For uploading code in Attiny-85
